# Weather App ☀️ ⛈️ ❄️

There's no secret: this application intends to show the weather forecast in real-time.

Working on this project, I would like to try using the **Axios** library to make requests to an API and access the **user's location**, besides being able to work with **web push notifications**.

Excited to see the results :)
